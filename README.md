# FirstAIProject

My first independent AI project. 

Problem Statement: Build a chatbot that takes in user queries, edits them at the backend with prompt engineering techniques, and forwards them to OpenAI GPT4 models (LLMs, not embedding models), and displays the response on the UI

With this project, the goal is to build expertise with basic LLM operations via applications and develop a basic folder structure, project structure, and logical structure for developing solutions

Tools going to be used:
Language: Python
Text Editor: Sublime Text Editor
Model:
OS: MacOS
